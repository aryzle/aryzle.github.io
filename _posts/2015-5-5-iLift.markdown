iLift is an iOS app that let's you record your weight lifting numbers but doesn't get in the way. It has a list of workouts with different rep and set ranges but you can edit them all and reuse the template of each workout. It has a timer for proper resting and even gives you motivating messages, all the while showing you images of other body builders to motivate you. Everyone loves Arnold!
